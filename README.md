# BULLS AND COWS

Bulls and Cows is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

![Responsiveness image](assets/img/responsiveness.png)

[BULLS AND COWS game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) is a popular guessing game that can be played by two or more people. The object of the game is to guess a secret code consisting of a sequence of digits. Each guess is compared to the secret code, and the number of "bulls" and "cows" is counted and revealed to the guesser. In this version of the game, the computer generates a secret number which the user must guess.

## How to play
1. The game is played with a four unique-digit number.
2. The computer generates a random number for the player to guess.
3. The player makes a guess by entering a 4-digit number.
4. If the player guesses a digit that is in the correct position in
the chosen number, it is called a "bull".
5. If the player guesses a digit that is in the chosen number, but
in a different position, it is called a "cow".
6. The computer responds to each guess with the number of bulls
and cows. For example, if the chosen number is 4827 and the player
guesses 1234, the computer would respond with "0 bulls, 2 cow" because
the player guessed the digit 2, which is in the chosen number, but
in a different position.
7. The player continues to guess until they correctly guess the entire
number (i.e., four bulls).

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

- Game rules should be displayed first in the terminal so that the user has a clear understanding of how to play.

- Validation methods should cover all possible values the user can input.

- Since it is a terminal application with limited possibilities in terms of design, it is important to have a font color scheme that is pleasant to the eye.

- Each step of the game should be accompanied by a hint so that the user always understands what they should do.

- After each guess, the user should see not only the current score but also all previous results.

- After guessing the secret number, the user is offered the option to start a new game or end the game.

### User Stories

- As a player, I would like to get acquainted with the game rules first so that I can have a clear understanding of how to play and what is expected of me.

- As a player, I would like to receive short and clear hints on what to do at each step of the game so that I can progress through the game without confusion and frustration.

- As a player, I would like the color scheme to be pleasing to the eye and not irritating so that I can play the game comfortably without experiencing eye strain or discomfort.

- As a player, I would like the game to not end if I enter incorrect data and give me a clear understanding of what I did wrong so that I can learn from my mistakes and continue playing the game.

- As a player, I would like to see all the current results of the game so that it's easier for me to make further decisions.

- As a player, I would like to have the ability to continue or end the game according to my own wishes so that I can play the game at my own pace and decide when to stop or continue playing.

### Color Scheme

[Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) has been used to apply color to the terminal text for improved intuition and readability. 

Here are the colors being used:

#### Infoline color:
![Infoline color](assets/img/iline-color.png)

#### Game Rules color:
![Game rules](assets/img/rules-color.png)

#### Error colors:
![Error colors](assets/img/error-color.png)

#### Guess colors:
![Guess colors](assets/img/guess-color.png)

#### Win game colors:
![Win game colors](assets/img/win-color.png)

#### Restart Game color:
![Restart Game colors](assets/img/restart-color.png)

#### End game colors:
![End game colors](assets/img/end-color.png)


### Data Model

I decided to use Guess class as a template. This class takes two lists as instance parameters during initialization. The first parameter is passed as an argument when creating an instance of the class, which is based on user input. The second parameter contains a list of digits for the secret number, generated by number_generator function. Guess class also contains class attribute called guess_list, which adds to the list instance attributes after each initialization.

Guess class has methods for counting the number of digits that are in the correct position (BULLS) and counting the number of digits that are in the chosen number (COWS).

Guess class has also show_all_scores method that generates a dictionary of guess/score pairs as key|value pairs and prints all scores in the terminal in user-friendly format

### Flowchart

[app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) program was utilized to create a flowchart which outlines the logical sequence to be incorporated into the program.

![flowchart](assets/img/flowchart.png)

## Features

### Existing features

#### Secret number generation
- Upon starting or restarting the game, the program generates a list of four unique digits at random that the player must guess. Currently, and for testing purposes, this list is visible (indicated by the red arrow), but it will be hidden before project submission: <#print(secret_number)>.

![Secret number](assets/img/secret-number.png)

#### Input validation
- Five types of exceptions were used to handle specific errors or unexpected situations that may arise from user input.

![Exceptions](assets/img/exceptions.png)

#### Guess and score output
- show_all_scores method from Guess class prints all the guesses and scores in a user-friendly format on the terminal.

![Guess|score output](assets/img/score-output.png)

#### Win game message
- Each time the Player wins, a bright victory message appears and the Player is presented with two options: either to continue playing or to exit the game. 

![Win message](assets/img/win-game.png)

#### Restart or End Game
- Restarting the game (by pressing 'Y') generates a new secret number, resets all class and class instance data, and begins a new cycle of the game.

![Restart game](assets/img/restarting-game.png)

#### Exiting the Game
- If the player exits the game (by pressing 'N'), the following message appears:  

![Exit game](assets/img/exit_game.png)

#### Invalid input
- If the player mistakenly presses a key other than 'Y' or 'N', an error message appears prompting them to correct their selection.

![Invalid input](assets/img/invalid-input.png)

### Future features

- Allow the player to choose a number with a different number of digits than 4 (e.g., a 5-digit number) for them to guess.

## Technologies Used
### Language Used

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

 - As a player, I would like to get acquainted with the game rules first so that I can have a clear understanding of how to play and what is expected of me.
    - Before starting the game, the [rules](#how-to-play) are displayed in the terminal to provide the user with a complete understanding of how to play. This ensures that every time the game is launched, the user is informed of the rules.

- As a player, I would like to receive short and clear hints on what to do at each step of the game so that I can progress through the game without confusion and frustration.
    - Throughout the game, prompts are provided to guide the user through each step and ensure their understanding.

- As a player, I would like the color scheme to be pleasing to the eye and not irritating so that I can play the game comfortably without experiencing eye strain or discomfort.
    - Given the limited design options in a terminal application, a [font color scheme](#color-scheme) that is easy on the eyes was employed.

- As a player, I would like the game to not end if I enter incorrect data and give me a clear understanding of what I did wrong so that I can learn from my mistakes and continue playing the game.
    - The use of [five types of exceptions](#input-validation) enables the handling of all specific errors or unexpected scenarios that may result from user input.

- As a player, I would like to see all the current results of the game so that it's easier for me to make further decisions.
    - Along with the current score, the user can view their [previous guesses and scores](#guess-and-score-output) after each attempt.
- As a player, I would like to have the ability to continue or end the game according to my own wishes so that I can play the game at my own pace and decide when to stop or continue playing.
    - Once the user has guessed the secret number, they can select [either to start a new game or end the current game](#restart-or-end-game).

These instructions should help you create a local copy of a code repository using both cloning and forking methods, allowing you to make changes to the code and collaborate with other developers on the project.

## Credits

- I'm acknowleged to my student friends who introduced me to the computer game Yahtzee back in the 80s. I tried to reproduce the design of that exact game as accurately as possible on my website.
- Since the JS code for creating an [interactive table](#max-score-panel) with historical results (Max score panel) was written with the help of prompts from the [GPT Chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat), it cannot be considered written by me personally.

### Content

- Markdown for the testing table in readme.md file was created using [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) 
- Grammar and spelling were checked using the power of [GPT Chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) web app. 

### Media

- All sound effects were taken from open source site [https://pixabay.com/](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/dice/).
- The images used as [Mockups](#mockup) were taken from open source sites.

### Code

- I've been constantly using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), 
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and Chrome Dev tools for inspiration 
and better understanding the code being implemented.
